# War  

War is a two player game. It's a race to see who can get all 52 cards first and along the way declaring WAR!

## Screenshot(s)

## Technology Used

To help me code the game I used the following technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* CSS Cardstarter Library

## Getting Started

https://github.com/LadyLioness951/WAR.git

## Next Steps

I plan on adding background music, a voice over when someone loses, each players deck showing, and a table under the cards.
