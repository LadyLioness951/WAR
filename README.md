# War  

War is a two player game. It's a race to see who can get all 52 cards first and along the way declaring WAR!

Have fun enjoy the background music.

## Next Steps

I plan on adding confetti when the game is over, adding a sound effect say Get Ready for WAR! along with the h1 WAR! bouncing around while the voice is talking.
